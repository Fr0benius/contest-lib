#+TITLE: Readme

A small (but slowly growing!) library for programming contests.

- The =compile_flags= file is for clang tools (Currently using =clangd=). This file should exist in some ancestor of the working directory. Since I'm using GCC on macOS, it's installed in a weird place so I had to remove the system include folders:
 ```
-nostdinc++
-I/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/10.2.0/include/c++/10.2.0/
-I/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/10.2.0/include/c++/10.2.0/x86_64-apple-darwin19/
 ```
they should be replaced whenever gcc gets upgraded. Maybe I should create some symlinks...

Really, the standard includes are OK as long as you use stuff that is both in GCC and Clang. That means ~gcd~, ~lcm~, policy-based data structures, and maybe some ~__builtin_...~ functions would be flagged as errors.
